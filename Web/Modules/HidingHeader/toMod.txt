We need some way to allow the "student" to view the documents. preferable which quick print access and some way that they cannot copy and paste the information.

Either:
	The show head and hide header pages should realy emphasize the importance of hiding the header
		OR
	The home page should explain that this example is simply meant to help one picture the main idea.
