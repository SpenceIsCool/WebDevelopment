The basic set up for an html site looks as follows.

NOTE: Until you can do this with ease you should not copy and paste it.

rel: this is used by screen readers and various boolean searches. It is important that you use these and provide apt discriptions of the content it represents

White space does not matter with relation to the tags but it will change the way in which your information is displayed.

<tag> start tag
</tag> end tag

class = "className" - see notes on css for more information

id = "idName" - see notes on js for mor information
